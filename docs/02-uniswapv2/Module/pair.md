```

### pairLiquidityMinted

_Calculates the exact amount of liquidity tokens minted from a given amount of token0 and token1._
_totalSupply is total supply of pair liquidity token._
_totalSupply must be looked up on-chain._
_The value returned from this function cannot be used as an input to getLiquidityValue._

```graphql
  pairLiquidityMinted(
    pair: Pair!
    totalSupply: TokenAmount!
    tokenAmount0: TokenAmount!
    tokenAmount1: TokenAmount!
  ): TokenAmount
```

### pairLiquidityValue

_Calculates the exact amount of token0 or token1 that the given amount of liquidity tokens represent._
_totalSupply is total supply of pair liquidity token._
_totalSupply must be looked up on-chain._
_If the protocol charge is on, feeOn must be set to true, and kLast must be provided from an on-chain lookup._
_Values returned from this function cannot be used as inputs to getLiquidityMinted._

```graphql
  pairLiquidityValue(
    pair: Pair!
    totalSupply: TokenAmount!
    liquidity: TokenAmount!
    feeOn: Boolean
    kLast: BigInt
  ): [TokenAmount!]!
```
